============

*One day, two organisations, three dimensions*

This is a really simple web app prototype conceived and developed over one working day. It has been cobbled together very quickly, don't expect many (if any) coding best practises.

It was designed to demonstrate visualising 3D Web Feature Service data (representing drill/bore holes) using a web browser in a semi interactive fashion.

To build: `mvn package`

To run in a local jetty container:

- Windows `run_jetty.bat`
- *nix `run_jetty.sh`
 
Then hit http://localhost:8080/index.html with a web browser.
